React is among the top 10 frameworks in 2023. Almost every company including **Apple**, **Github**, **Airbnb**, **Discord**, **Netflix**, and **Pinterest** among others are using React for better web experiences.

In this blog we’ll explore some of the fundamentals in using React on creating real world applications. By the end of this post you will have a more solid understanding of how to write your web applications in React and why it has become so popular.

## Architecture

- Root

This is among the most crucial parts of writing any React applications. I want to start off by saying there is no _"good"_ way to architecture your project, but there some very good architecture practices you can follow.

The illustration above shows how you can organize your files and folders in your project. The folders on the left are the top-level folders. These are essentially the root folders of your project. The build directory is generated by the command [npm run build](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/).

- Nesting

Having a good architecture enables you to easily scale your application and have things in a clean way. You can also see from the illustration how the leaf directories look like. The naming convention of your files and folders ultimately depends on you.

## Good coding practices

**Modular Components:**

This means that you have break down each component to only handle one thing. Break the UI down into small reusable components.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import UserData from "./UserData";

const UserProfile = ({ props }) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
      {props.map((prop, i) => (
        <UserData key={i} data={prop} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;
```

Instead of mapping through the users data and rendering it on the users profile. You can make the user data into a different component and this means now means the UserData component can be reusable in other parts of your code

## State Management

This can be one of the most challenging bits as your application grows. Managing state can be very “messy”. There different ways to solve this “mess”

- Lifting State

Lifting state is the practice of managing state in a common ancestor component and passing it down to its descendants as props. This enables communication between components that might not have a direct parent-child relationship. Let's explore this concept through a simple example.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import React, { useState } from "react";

// Counter component
const Counter = ({ count, onIncrement }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Counter: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={onIncrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

// Display component
const Display = ({ count }) => {
  return <p>Display: {count}</p>;
};

// App component (parent)
const App = () => {
  // State for count
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Handler for incrementing count
  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Counter component with count and onIncrement prop */}
      <Counter count={count} onIncrement={handleIncrement} />

      {/* Display component with count prop */}
      <Display count={count} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

- Using state managment libraries

  One of my personal favourite is redux-toolkit. It gives me full controll over my intended actions and i can[easily set it up](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/). There are many other state managment libraries one can use. It all depends with the needs of your apllication

- Context api

This is a built in react state managment solution. In the illustration at the top of the page you can see the folder. That can be also responsible for managing state. One thing to have at the back of your mind is to always wrap your app in the context of choice in order to access the data anywhere in you application. This is what i am reffering too

## Dry-coding

Dry coding is a common practice among software developers in any tech stack. Its a good practice to avoid redundancy. Check more on the same

## Conclusion

The more you code, the more you'll grasp the intricacies of this library and uncover its vast potential. Keep exploring, keep coding, and let React be your companion in crafting extraordinary front-end experiences.
